## Product Defects 

## Goal 

The goal of this jupyter notebook is to showcase my understanding of how probability in python can help analize product defects in a factory. 
By understanding that the poisson distribution is special because the rate parameter represents the expected value of the distribution, in this 
case it is 7.  In the jupyter notebook I was able to investigate the amount of defective products the factory could see in a given amount of time.
